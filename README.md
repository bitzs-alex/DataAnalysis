## Purpose
---
  
The purpose of this github repository is to document all the project I put my hands on while learning Data Analysis.
  
## Structure
---
Each project has it's own folder.  
All of the codes are written either using jupyter Notebook or Python File, and they can be find inside the projects folder. The Datasets associated with the project can be found in the corresponding `Datasets` folder inside each projects folder.
  
## Requirements
---
To clone the project and run the repository in your local machine the following points are worth mentioning.
- I used Python as main programming language so installing Python is the first thing
- Since most of the codes are Notebooks, make sure you installed the following packages using you Python package manager `pip`
    - ipython
    - jupyterlab
    - matplotlib
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - seaborn
    - tweepy

  
To install the packages you need to type following command in your command line interface.
```
pip install [package_name]
```
Don't forget to replace the `[package_name]` by the name of the package you wanted to install.
